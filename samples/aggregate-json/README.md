# Aggregating JSON sample

This sample shows how to make concurrent outgoing HTTP requests and combine the results.

In this simple example, there are two requests, and the sample combines values
from the resulting JSON documents into an array. In a real world situation, these
could be requests to data services, and could be combined in other ways.
